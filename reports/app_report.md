## Application Log Analysis Report

### Date and Time Formats:

*   **apache.log:** `[Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY]` (e.g., `[Thu Jun 09 06:07:04 2005]`)
*   **resource_metrics.csv:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff` (e.g., `2025-04-06 02:28:21.582285`)
*   **syslog.log:** `Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY` (e.g., `Sun Apr  6 01:20:27 2025`)

### Key Observations and Potential Security Events:

*   **apache.log:**
    *   "Directory index forbidden" errors: Potential misconfiguration or attempted unauthorized access.
    *   "File does not exist" errors: Broken links, incorrect URLs, or missing resources (e.g., favicon.ico).
    *   Errors related to channel.jni, vm, and worker.jni may indicate issues with application setup and initialization of the Java components.
*   **resource_metrics.csv:**
    *   Contains CPU, memory, and disk utilization metrics that can be plotted over time to identify performance trends and bottlenecks.
*   **syslog.log:**
    *   Multiple "TPM hardware failed to execute a TPM command" errors: Potential hardware issue or TPM driver/configuration problem.
    *   DCOM errors (Event ID 10010, 10016): Issues with application activation.
    *   Detection of potential CVE exploits (Event ID 1): Indicates the system has identified attempted exploitations of known vulnerabilities. These should be investigated further.
    *   DNS resolution errors for time.windows.com: Time synchronization issues.
    *   TCP/IP address conflict. Possible network misconfiguration or malicious activity

### Traffic Patterns and Relevant Numerical Data:

*   **resource_metrics.csv:** CPU percentage, memory percentage, and disk percentage data are available for plotting over time. The CPU percentage can be used to identify periods of high CPU utilization, which may indicate performance bottlenecks or resource exhaustion. The memory and disk percentages can similarly be used to track memory and disk usage patterns.

### Missing Logs
*   **service.log:** File not found
*   **kernel.log:** File not found
*   **os_events.txt:** File not found
