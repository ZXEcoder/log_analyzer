# Log Analysis Report - 2025-04-06 03:11:39 India Standard Time+0530

## Analysis Summary:
Summary: The analysis reveals several kernel power events, service control manager events, TPM errors, Windows update activity, DNS client errors, time service issues, and Bluetooth errors in the system logs. Application logs show directory index forbidden errors and file not found errors. Resource metrics provide CPU, memory, and disk utilization data. Anomaly detection highlights under-utilized and over-utilized resources. CVE detections in system logs requires immediate attention.
Highest Severity: Critical
Requires Immediate Attention: True

## Key Observations (System Logs):
- Numerous Kernel Power events indicate power-related activities.
- Frequent changes in the start type of the "Background Intelligent Transfer Service" (BITS) are observed.
- Multiple entries indicate failures of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware.
- Name resolution timeouts suggest potential DNS server issues or network connectivity problems.
- NtpClient encounters DNS resolution errors indicating possible time synchronization problems.
- Bluetooth errors reported when Windows cannot store Bluetooth authentication codes.
- DCOM errors are also present.
- Potential CVE detections require immediate investigation.
- Secure boot update failure.
- IP address conflict.

## Key Observations (Application/Microservice Logs):
- "Directory index forbidden" errors: Potential misconfiguration or attempted unauthorized access.
- "File does not exist" errors: Broken links, incorrect URLs, or missing resources (e.g., favicon.ico).
- Errors related to channel.jni, vm, and worker.jni may indicate issues with application setup and initialization of the Java components.

## Security Events (System Logs):
- Possible detection of CVE events with specific CVE IDs and timestamps.
- Secure Boot update failure.
- IP address conflict.

## Security Events (Application/Microservice Logs):
- No specific security events are explicitly present in the provided application log snippets, but "Directory index forbidden" errors could be related to unauthorized access attempts.

## Traffic Patterns (System Logs):
- Frequency of Kernel Power events, DNS timeout events, and CVE detections can be plotted over time to reveal patterns. See provided table in "System Log Analysis Report"

## Traffic Patterns (Application/Microservice Logs):
- No specific traffic patterns are apparent from the provided application log snippets. The access patterns (successful vs. failed requests) to different files can be plotted.

## Resource Usage Analysis:
- Link to Resource Usage Chart: ./plots/resource_usage.png
- Anomaly Detection Summary:
Under‑utilized CPU (< 10%) at 60 timestamps. Consider reducing CPU allocation.
Under‑utilized Memory (< 10%) at 60 timestamps. Consider reducing Memory allocation.
Over‑utilized CPU (> 80%) at 5 timestamps. Consider increasing CPU allocation.
Over‑utilized Memory (> 80%) at 5 timestamps. Consider increasing Memory allocation.

## Tuning Recommendations:
- Investigate the "Possible detection of CVE" events immediately. Determine the affected systems and apply necessary patches or mitigations.
- Examine the TPM errors and determine if there's a hardware fault or configuration issue.
- Monitor the BITS service start type changes to ensure the service is functioning correctly.
- Investigate the DNS timeout errors and ensure DNS servers are reachable and functioning correctly.
- Address the Bluetooth adapter errors.
- Investigate the root cause of the Secure Boot update failure and ensure that Secure Boot is properly configured to protect the system.
- Based on resource usage analysis, consider adjusting CPU and memory allocation based on under/over utilization.
- Address "Directory index forbidden" errors in application logs by properly configuring access permissions.
- Fix broken links or missing resources causing "File does not exist" errors.
- Ensure time synchronization is working correctly across the infrastructure.
